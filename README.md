# Math Magicians

> Single Page Application that displays a web-based calculator.

The objective of this exercise was to install React using create-react-app and set up linters and README. 
Later, we had to assemble a calculator using React, and the provided calculator code. Then, we had to create three pages
and their navigation using React Router. The final objective was to write and run unit, component and ui tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
